<h1><em>About Me</em></h1>
<p>I am Muhammad Haris, currently pursuing my Bachelor degree in Accounting & Finance at university of Derby. I'm learning to code to potentially change my career and become a full stack web developer.</p>
<p>Ever since I was a child, I have always been obsessed with the technology and web and their mechanisms. So to learn to code, I am learning through Dr.Angela's web development course and I intend to attend a full stack web development Boot-camp in the near future as well.</p>

<p>Although my journey to learn to code is surely going to be challenging, I am however fully determined and intent on achieving my goals to become a full stack web developer.</p>
